Capstone 2 Project (Student Performance)

![alt text](image.png)



The United States of America spends the second most amount of money in the world per student. However student academic performances in math and reading in the U.S. fall below that of students from other developed countries. My goal is to develop ML models that help make schools more efficient with time and money by predicting academic level of students and class failures. Administrators usually build schedules for students in the summer and being able to identify students at risk will help them determine how much intervention will be needed for the academic year. Additionally being able to predict which students might fail their class will help to set up intervention early in the year. Furthermore identifing students who are academically excelling will help inform teachers on rigor of lessons to promote academic growth. 


1) The data was obtained from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)

This data set tracks Portugese student's academic performance through out one school year. The students are ages 15-22. Additional features from this data include: studytime, family relationship, school and family support, amount of free time, absences, health, alochol use and several other features. 



2) In Loading_cleaning the data is loaded and features are created to calculate average grades earned by students for the year. Absence feature is created to calculate absence as a percent. Quick EDA is performed to get a sense of the data set. Additionally I create categorical features to label students based on the percentlie of their average grade 'low','average' and 'high'. Categorical and object features are also transformed using one-hot encoding to prepare data for modeling.
